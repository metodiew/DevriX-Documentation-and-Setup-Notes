# DevriX-Documentation-and-Setup-Notes
This a GitHub repository which will collect all documentation and setup details. They are shared here, so they can be moved to the proper Wiki documents, categories and the like

In this repository you'll find all Stanko Metodiev's notes, collected during the years.

Once we collect them in one place, you'll be able to re-use them and move them to the proper places in our planned wiki
